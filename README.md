~~# Dermo-December~~
~~Updated December version~~

Looks like this is my first commit, I must have created the repositiory but never finished publishing. 

This was a project I did for fun a few years ago using Apple's CoreML software to basically recognize and diagnose skin diseases. Likewise, this project ended up being too much of an ethical concern and liability, so the model is open sourced. If you are looking to utilize this project checkout this sample app here and just switch the two models. -> https://developer.apple.com/documentation/vision/classifying_images_with_vision_and_core_ml

(If things are completely broken, thanks to apple pushing SwiftUI at everyone, send me an email: tyler@kruerindustries.org or and I would be happy to help.)

Hopefully this project inspires others to innovate the field of medicine and technology. ✅
